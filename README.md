# HUA Labs – Human–AI Resonance Framework

Designing SDKs and protocols for emotionally intelligent AI systems.

We create lightweight, intuitive tools to help AI systems resonate with human emotions and context — not just respond. Our mission: empower LLM-based experiences to feel more empathic, contextual, and human-aware.

## Core Projects

- hua-sdk-lite – TypeScript SDK for emotion-aware LLM interaction (tone / mode / tier presets)
- hua-demo-template – Interactive Vite + React demo to explore resonant UX

## Features

- Internationalization (i18n-ready: ko / en)
- Type-safe, developer-friendly TypeScript
- Ready for real-world deployment (npm, Vercel, Supabase)
- Extensible preset architecture for human-AI alignment

## Why HUA?

**HUA = Human–AI Resonance Protocol.**  
We believe the future of AI lies not only in intelligence — but in resonance.  
Whether you're building a chatbot, a coaching tool, or a reflective companion,  
HUA SDKs help AI sound like it understands — not just answers.
